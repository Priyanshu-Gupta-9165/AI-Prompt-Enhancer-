## 🌟 About The Project

In the rapidly evolving world of AI, the quality of your input prompt directly dictates the quality of the output. Many users struggle to get the desired results from AI models because their prompts are too basic or lack necessary context.

AI Prompt Enhancer solves this by providing a simple interface to:
*   Take a user's basic idea.
*   Programmatically add key prompt engineering elements like persona/role, context, desired output format, tone, constraints, and model-specific instructions.
*   Offer a structured, professional prompt ready to be used.

This project is built entirely with client-side technologies (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript), making it lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy anywhere.

## 🏁 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    If you have Git installed:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub repository path if you've pushed it there.)

    Alternatively, download the `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files directly into a single folder on your computer.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory (if cloned):**
    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    Simply double-click the `index.html` file in the project folder, or right-click it and choose "Open with" your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

That's it! The application will run locally in your browser.

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Enter Basic Prompt:** Type your initial idea or question into the "Your Basic Prompt" textarea.
2.  **Select AI Model:** Choose your target AI model from the "Target AI Model" dropdown. This helps tailor instructions.
3.  **(Optional) Customize Enhancements:**
    *   Review and toggle the checkboxes under "Enhancement Options" to include or exclude specific sections in your professional prompt.
    *   If "Add Role/Persona" is checked, a field will appear allowing you to type a specific custom role.
4.  **Generate:** Click the "✨ Enhance Prompt" button.
5.  **Review & Copy:** The professionally structured and enhanced prompt will appear in the "Your Enhanced Prompt" box.
6.  **Copy:** Click the "📋 Copy to Clipboard" button. You'll get a confirmation message.
7.  **Use in AI Tool:** Paste the copied prompt into your chosen AI platform (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude).
8.  **Fill Placeholders:** **Crucially, manually replace bracketed placeholders like `[Specify context here]` or `[Describe the desired tone...]` within the copied prompt with your specific details before submitting it to the AI.** The more specific you are, the better the AI's response will be.
